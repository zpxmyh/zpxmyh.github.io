##### **1. MatterGPT:a GPT2-based large language model for multi-property inverse design of crystal structures.**

Our research is centered on advancing the field of computational materials discovery by pioneering generative artificial intelligence for the inverse design of crystalline materials. We aim to provide a powerful and precise framework for generating novel solid-state materials with tailored properties and structures on-demand. A key aspect of our work involves the development of SLICES, an invertible and invariant "crystal language" that enables the application of state-of-the-art transformer models. This foundation allows our custom-built generative model, MatterGPT, to effectively learn the complex grammar of crystal structures and their intrinsic relationship to physical properties.

We investigate the conditional generation of materials targeting both lattice-insensitive properties, such as formation energy, and lattice-sensitive properties, like energy band gap. Crucially, we address the challenge of controlling spatial symmetry—a significant inductive bias often overlooked in generative design—by introducing SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced representation that explicitly encodes symmetry operations. This allows us to target specific crystal systems with high fidelity. Additionally, we extend our framework to sophisticated multi-objective design problems, demonstrating the simultaneous generation of crystals that meet multiple property criteria, such as specific formation energies and band gaps, or the targeted design of cubic crystals with desired bulk and shear moduli in a few-shot learning context.
