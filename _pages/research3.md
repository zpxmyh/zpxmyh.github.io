##### **3. When Strong Bases Act Weak: Nanoscale Hydration Governs Humidity-Swing CO₂ Capture**

Understanding how ion hydration changes under confinement is crucial for designing next-generation direct air capture (DAC) sorbents. Early computational and experimental work showed that incomplete hydration shells inside nanopores drive the spontaneous hydrolysis of carbonate, enabling moisture-swing CO₂ uptake on anion-exchange resins and related porous supports. Building on this paradigm, we recently theoretically studied guanidine, a prototypical super-base (pKₐ ≈ 13.6), in clusters containing only one to eight water molecules. Ab-initio free-energy profiles reveal that limited water severely suppresses proton abstraction, so guanidine can no longer generate OH⁻; under nanoconfinement it therefore behaves as a weak base.

Strikingly, this counter-intuitive prediction was confirmed by [ambient-pressure experiments](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.202402685): per-alkylated guanidines capture nearly one mole of CO₂ per mole base only in moist air and release it quantitatively once the residual water is evaporated at 70 °C, achieving a working capacity of 4.5 mol kg⁻¹ with a minimal 45 °C temperature swing.

These results extend the humidity-swing concept from weak inorganic bases to strong organic bases, uncovering a universal “hydration tuning” mechanism that converts base strength into a controllable switch. Elucidating this nanoscale chemistry opens a path to scalable, low-energy DAC materials guided by rational hydration design.
